  <h1 class="head1"> Field Hockey </h1>
  
  <p class="p1"> Field Hockey is  a game played on a field that looks like a football field. There is a net at each end, in which two teams of 11 players each compete in driving a small ball into the other's goal. Each player has a stick with a curved end that is flat on one side and rounded on the other </p>

    <td>Defensive Players </td>
    <td>Defense is the line of players closest to the goalie. Many people would group the <br>
 goalie in as a defensive player because their main goal is to keep the ball out of the net.</td>
